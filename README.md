# Who I am? üëã #

The site was opened for several reasons, I am currently activ at Coding Bootcamp Europe as a student to actively learn how I can realize myself as a web developer and create this project according to my wishes and expectations.

## The Page "Care for the HL" ##

This is a topic that has moved me for a long time, and I'll use a slogan:  
"Do more than just watch!"   
So all the news about what I'm going to use for my project will update here. but it still takes a while.

üíûÔ∏è I can tell you that much, the project was created so that we can make the world a little bit better. But please be patient!
